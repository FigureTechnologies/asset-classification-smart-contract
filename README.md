# Asset Classification Smart Contract

This contract analyzes Provenance Blockchain [scope](https://docs.provenance.io/modules/metadata-module#scope-data-structures)
metadata to verify that basic portions of newly-generated asset structures are correct, and then allows third parties
to verify the contents of the asset by granting permission to them.

## Getting Started

To build the smart contract, simply run the following:
```shell
make optimize
```

Deployment instructions are currently under development.
